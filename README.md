# Uzbekistan and Tashkent-Dushanbe Temperature Analysis

![Uzbekistan and Tashkent-Dushanbe Temperature Analysis]


## Context

Global warming is the ongoing rise of the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming - Wikipedia.

Understanding the temperature patterns in specific regions is essential for analyzing the impact of global warming on local climates. Uzbekistan and Tashkent-Dushanbe, being major cities in the region, provide valuable insights into the temperature trends.

Thanks to the University of Dayton, the dataset containing daily level average temperature values for Tashkent-Dushanbe and other major cities is available [here](https://dataset-link-here). The data is available for research and non-commercial purposes only. Please refer to this page for the license.
